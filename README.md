# Introduction

This repository contains the source code and compiled binary for a 2048 board game implemented in Assembly language for the 8088 processor. The game provides a nostalgic experience of programming for vintage hardware and can be run using DOSBox.

# Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following:

- DOSBox installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of Assembly language programming.
- A code editor to view and modify the source code.

# Getting Started

## Setting Up DOSBox

1. Download and install [DOSBox](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dosbox/) on your system.

## Running the Game

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/Mabdullahatif/2048_BoardGame_Assemblyx88.git

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```text
cd 2048_BoardGame_Assemblyx88

```

3. Launch DOSBox and mount the project directory. Replace `path-to-project` with the actual path to the project directory:
```text
mount c 2048_BoardGame_Assemblyx88

```

4. Switch to the mounted drive:
```text
c:

```

5. Run the game executable:
```text
2048.com

```
# Playing the Game

Once you have the game running in DOSBox, follow these instructions to play:

- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to shift the tiles in the desired direction.
- Tiles with the same value will merge when they collide.
- Your goal is to create a tile with the value of 2048.

# Controls

- **Up Arrow:** Shift tiles upwards.
- **Down Arrow:** Shift tiles downwards.
- **Left Arrow:** Shift tiles to the left.
- **Right Arrow:** Shift tiles to the right.
- **Esc:** Exit the game.

# Game Rules

- Tiles with the same value merge into a single tile of double the value when they collide.
- After every move, a new tile with the value of 2 will appear on the board.
- The game ends when you successfully create a tile with the value of 2048, or there are no valid moves left.

# Acknowledgments

This project is inspired by the original 2048 game created by Gabriele Cirulli. Special thanks to the Assembly language community for their resources and support.
